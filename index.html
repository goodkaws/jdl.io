<p><span id="greeting"></span>, I'm Jonathan. I'm a nerd with a penchant for intellectually stimulating content and the internet. I like leisurely drives, vehicles, reading <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a>, and indulging in one of the greatest delights in life: eating!</p>

<p>I'm currently working in Bethesda, MD for Apple. I attend college here in Maryland for Computer Networks & Security.</p>

<p>If you want, you can follow my thoughts on <a href="http://twitter.com/whoislaster">Twitter</a> or shoot me an <a href="mailto:jonathan@laster.co?subject=Hello Jonathan!">e-mail</a>. I would love to hear from you!</p>
