My amateur attempt at an exhaust video. I was searching for catted [42 Draft Designs](http://www.42draftdesigns.com) exhaust clips before purchasing my exhaust and didn't find very many so I decided to make my own video. It seems most people get the cat-less systems. 

I didn't go too hard. Just slight take offs since I need a new clutch. Recorded on an iPhone 6 Plus.
