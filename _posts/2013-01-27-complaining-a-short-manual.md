D. Keith Robinson, Product Designer for Heroku, wrote a blog post around the subject of complaining. It made me do some self reflecting. I'd like to share the first two points of it with you:

> Complaining is lame. I do it much more than I’m comfortable with, you do it, people you want to like do it. We can be better. Here’s how:
>
> <b>One.</b> Ask, “would my dad complain about this?” (Feel free to replace “dad” with anyone else you look up to. I use my dad because my dad was awesome.) If not, STFU and move on.
>
> <b>Two.</b> Ask yourself, “will my complaining do anyone (including myself) any good?” Most likely the answer is no. Zip it. Go meditate, exercise, eat a Twinkie, etc.
