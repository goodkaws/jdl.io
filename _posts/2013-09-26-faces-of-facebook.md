[The Faces of Facebook](http://thefacesoffacebook.com) â€“ Visualizing 1.2 billion Facebook profile images. This app shows over 1,262,094,184 Facebook profile pictures and organizes them into chronological order. 

What's interesting is how this app was built. A facebook profile picture of smallest dimension (50px by 50px) will have minimum size of 3kb. So, if this site would have shown real profile pics all together, it'll have to load almost 3.5 terabytes of data for 1.2 billion pictures. A connection with 100Kb/s downloading speed will take around 430 days, and a connection with 1MB/s will take around 42 days. The developer of this page knew no one would be interested to spend more than 2 minutes on this page. Lol. So he knew to resize each image down A LOT to pull this off. 

This app works because you can access someone's facebook page with the URL www.facebook.com/"#". With the number being the numbered profile they are. I find it interesting that Zuck is actually number 4 ([facebook.com/4](http://facebook.com/4)), numbers 1-3 are missing. I wonder why? 

There are several gaps in between the first 50 ID numbers. Probably some early test/fake accounts as well as people who deleted/deactivated their account. Eduardo Saverin (co-founder) has ID #41 and Joe Green has #42. For those who don't know, Joe Green originally helped Mark Zuckerburg create FaceSmash. This app isn't perfect though. Some of the numbers are out of order. Still interesting!
