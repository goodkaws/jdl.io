[Matthew Mullenweg](http://ma.tt) linked to a very interesting article about the ever controversial Uber service that is spreading rapidly from city to city. I'd love to share it with you all!

Emily Guendelsberger of the [Philadelphia City Paper](http://citypaper.net/emilyg/) put in 100 undercover hours as an UberX driver in Philadelphia and [wrote about the experience](http://citypaper.net/uberdriver/). In this fascinating and well written read, she focused on the economics of the entire experience of being an Uber driver.

*SPOILER:* This is a long read!
