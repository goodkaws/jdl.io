<a href="http://ma.tt">Matthew Mullenweg</a> linked to a very interesting article about the ever controversial Uber service that is spreading rapidly from city to city. I'd love to share it with you all!

Emily Guendelsberger of the <a href="http://citypaper.net/emilyg/">Philadelphia City Paper</a> put in 100 <a href="http://citypaper.net/uberdriver/">undercover hours as an UberX driver in Philadelphia and wrote about the experience.</a> In this fascinating and well written read, she focused on the economics of the entire experience of being an Uber driver.

<i>SPOILER:</i> This is a long read!
