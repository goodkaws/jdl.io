In my previous post about [Duck Duck Go]({{site.baseurl}}/switching-to-ddg), I gave a (half-assed) review of my journey to switch to Duck Duck Go search for my iOS and Mac workflows.

Interestingly enough, part of what made that transition hard was the feeling that DDG's results don't feel like Google results. Well, half the battle was visual.

I changed my DDG theme for a while to use colors similar to Google, and found myself using [DDG’s bang](https://duckduckgo.com/bang), “!g”, less often. That has disturbing implications for just how conditioned I was towards Google search results.

I’ve decided to share what settings I used to make my DDG experience, look more like a Google experience (shamefully). So navigate to DDG’s settings page and let’s get started. 

### Theme

DDG has several theme bundles you can choose from to switch up the appearance for yourself.

The *Basic Theme* gives you the general appearance of Google’s search. The key to the Basic theme is that the URL is located below the title of the link, instead of below the description. 

### Results Appearance 

 Next, we’ll set some colors and options. For ease, I’ll just list them below. 

* Result Title Font: <code>Arial</code> 

* Result Title Color: <code>#1a0dab</code>

* Result Visited Title Color: <code>#660099</code>

* Result Title Underline: <code>Off</code> - Unfortunately, there isn’t a setting to underline the title when hovering over it. 

* Result Description Color: <code>#545454</code>

* Result URL Color: <code>#009636</code>

Now your search results should feel Google-esque.
