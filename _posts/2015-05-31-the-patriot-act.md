The [Patriot Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act) is set to expire at 12:01 tomorrow morning unless the Senate votes to extend it. This highly debated topic seems to be the center of my universe at work, as it is debated by many of my coworkers.  

The majority consensus among my friends and coworkers is that The Patriot Act should be **completely** expired. Their justification is that the act is a complete invasion of privacy. They argue that the government cannot—or have not—shown examples of The Patriot Act being utilized to prevent a terrorist attack. "If the policy isn’t effective, why do we need it?" they ask.

### *My Thoughts*
I will state my opinion: Not extending the The Patriot Act will weaken the government’s ability to prevent terrorist attacks. 

Why would the US government list out every time that the Act did it’s job? I’d argue that listing these times to appease the public would actually be detrimental to the security of the nation. The government works on a need to know basis. Why help the bad guys strategize by telling them where, when, and how they went wrong before?

The Patriot Act is definitely now, more than ever, more privacy-invasive since it's initial entry into the books. I argue though, that not one soul can say they were unjustly arrested or had their privacy invaded based on the notion that the government was able to connect dots based on surveilling your communications. Essentially, there has been very little noise from anyone that can point to a direct case of misuse of information. 

What makes you so special that you think there is some government analyst sitting in his office looking up your specific communications? I take the line of thinking that if you aren’t connected with any terrorist, you aren’t flagged in the Act's system for tracking. 

Yes, that’s right… if you’re communicating with the largest drug dealer in San Francisco, you still haven’t been flagged in the system. For arguments sake, let's assume you're flagged, and the government saw where your drug deal is going down. The policy is set up that they can’t legally use that information against you. 

The purpose of The Patriot Act is for defense against terrorism. Period. Not to catch relatively small-time wrong doings in the act. Now, in this example, if the drug dealer makes a call to an affiliated member of ISIS, then yes, red flags galore in the Patriot Act system. Now the government has to check on why you were communicating with someone who has terrorist affiliates. It’s simple. 

So, I think letting The Patriot Act expire will be detrimental to our security. At least amend the policy to still keep some aspects in place. President Obama is pushing for the Senators to at least pass the USA Freedom Act. TIME Magazine does a great job of breaking what the Freedom Act is:

> The USA Freedom Act, a compromise bill that would extend some aspects of the Patriot Act while ending the National Security Agency’s ability to collect phone records in bulk. Under that reform bill, telecommunications companies would store customer’s metadata in bulk, but the NSA would need specific warrants to get someone’s data. The House passed the USA Freedom Act by a wide margin earlier this month, but some Senators are arguing that the bill doesn’t go far enough to protect American freedom and privacy.

I hope my opinion was able to give some readers perspective. I’d love to hear any comments or arguments for or against my opinion. [Please shoot me an email!](mailto:jonathan@laster.co?subject=Comments on The Patriot Act)
