Sahil Lavingia published a blog post today detailing how he started out coding. Sahil was an early employee at Pinterest and is now working on his first startup called [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com). I look up to Sahil because he embodies a young person who is simply doing what he loves to do - making applications that help/convenience people. In his blog post, Sahil expressed how he begin learning to code:

> I looked at sites that I liked, and tried to replicate them in Photoshop. Then I learned how to replicate my own designs in HTML and CSS (view source, view source, view source…). Then I started messing around with effects in JS (jQuery) to make the things I was building more compelling. After a year, I was able to think up and implement my own ideas, and that’s when it got really fun. If I had to start again, Dribbble would probably be my go-to source to learn from. Copy until you can invent.

I found this interesting because it is exactly how I've been learning! When I learned new techniques in HTML or CSS, I would try and replicate sites to see if I could return the same result visually. I thought doing so was looked down upon and everyone that I considered role models had this great ability to invent great designs from the start. I now have more confidants that as I become more fluent in these coding languages, my ideas will flourish!
