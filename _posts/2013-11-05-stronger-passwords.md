[Bruce Schneier](https://www.schneier.com/about.html) wrote a [great article](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/06/a_really_good_a.html) on how easy it is for malicious hackers to crack your passwords. I know several "non-technical" folks who use the most generic one word passwords I've ever seen. These folks are prime targets for having their password guessed. Ask yourselves, does it get down to laziness? 

I think everyone should pay more mind to securityâ€”especially phishing attempts. I can't tell you all how many times I receive spam through direct messages on Twitter, seen Dr. Oz spam posts on Instagram, and of course we remember the spam that was seen on Facebook. Often these victims are close friends of mine that pigeon-hole themselves into the "non-technical" box. 

It's time to start getting more serious about your password strengths and paying attention to the URL when a page asks you to log in to one of your accounts. 

Read the original [4-page article on Arstechnica](http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/08/passwords-under-assault/) about how hackers have never been stronger these days.
