67 years ago today, on September 9th, 1947, Computer Engineers working on the Mark II computer at Harvard University found a moth stuck in one of the components. They taped the insect in their logbook and labeled it, "first actual case of bug being found." I'm sure folks have been calling small flaws in machines "bugs" much longer than 66 years, but as the label describes, could this of been the first *literal* bug found in a computer?

The log book now resides at the National Museum of American History, but apparently is not currently on public view â€“ which seems a shame.
