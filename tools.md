This little guide will hopefully give you some good tools that can be used to improve your existing workflow. I care a lot about functionality, aesthetics, and optimization. Check it out!

**[Divvy](http://mizage.com/divvy/)** <br>
A fast keyboard-triggered tool to resize application windows on a predefined grid with shortcuts. An absolute must for HTML/CSS design with browser testing and programming with documentation & research.

**[Atom](https://atom.io/){:target="_blank"}** <br>
A good text editor is arguably the most important app in a developer’s toolkit. You’re only as good as your code, and you code in a text editor. Atom is my current editor of choice! An open-source text editor made by GitHub themselves. I love the awesome [documentation](https://atom.io/docs), modern design out the box, and Git integration. Also, browsing Atom's extensive trove of [packages](https://atom.io/packages), I can add cool features to the editor that didn't ship right out the box.

I originally used [TextMate](https://macromates.com), but TextMate’s development reached a dead end. Then I used [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), but it's advancement has severely slowed. Updates come months apart and community of contributors dwarfs Atom's. Sublime is still a great editor, but I wanted something more actively supported.

Hosting Git repositories remotely is crucial whether collaborating on projects with friends, anyone in the open-source community, or co-workers. GitHub makes this easy!

Github for your operating system is an excellent and simple graphical user interface to Git that removes much of the confusion for beginners. I highly recommend it if you have no concept of how to use Git and you don't want to commit the time to learn it with the command line. (As of June 2018, I've committed time to learning to work exclusively in the command line with Git)

I currently host this site using Github. [Read my post on hosting with Github]({{site.baseurl}}/hosted-on-github).

<img alt="Dropbox" id="tools-logo" src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/dropbox.png">
**[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com){:target="_blank"}** <br>
If you don't use Dropbox, start today. It will allow you to seamlessly synchronize files across any computer or device (Mac, PC, iPad, iPhone, etc). It creates a sort of hot folder where you can drop anything and see it appear on another device in minutes if not seconds depending on the size of the files.

Better yet, Dropbox acts as a cloud backup solution since all the files you sync are saved, even if you delete them from all of your devices accidentally.

Early on, I primarily used Dropbox to share files with friends using their [Shared Folders](https://www.dropbox.com/features/share/folders) feature. Now, I mainly use Dropbox to host my local code repository for this site. So, whether I'm on my Macbook Pro out-n-about, or at home on my desktop PC, my local code repository is always up to date on any machine I have Dropbox downloaded on. Just drop my repository file into Sublime Text and I'm ready to code.

**[1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword)** <br>
1Password is an amazing app which stores complex passwords for all your accounts under one main master password, allowing you to create virtually unbreakable passwords for every single one of your accounts.

And if a website's secure database is breached (a common occurrence of late), you won't care anymore. 1Password generates unique passwords, which means a third-party obtaining your Twitter password doesn't put any other one of your accounts at risk.

Since you don't want to open 1Password every time you need to use a password to sign in to a service, it comes with extensions for all major browsers that not only automatically fill the sign in form of any website for you (after prompting you for your master password), but also allows you to generate and save new credentials while remaining in your favorite browser.
